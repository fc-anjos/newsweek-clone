<!-- TITLE -->
# Responsive-Design
>  A clone of the [newsweek magazine](https://newsweek.com) website (February - March/2020), built as part of Microverse's Full Stack Development program

<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
This personal project aims at being a hands on experience to learn [the boostrap css library](https://getbootstrap.com/).
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) is used extensively, re-arranging the content with its responsible break-points and changing margins and paddings accordingly.   
A hint of javascript through the [jquery](https://jquery.com/) library is also used to add a dynamic header.
